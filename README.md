dwm - dynamic window manager

## What is dwm?

From the official dwm page,
> dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocle and floating layouts. All of the layouts can be applied dynamically, optimising the environment for the application in use and the task performed.

TL;DR - dwm is a tiling window manager.

## Why dwm? Why not i3, bspwm, etc...

I *much* prefer dwm to alternatives such as i3, bspwm and others due to its method of configuring it using patches, or simply developing it yourself! 

## Sounds cool, what are the features?

This will be filled in at a later date, once the build has been customized some more! :-)

## Keybinds!

**Install `libxft-bgra` from the AUR as it fixes a coloured emoji rendering issue.**
